<h1>How Can I Get Involved</h1>
<p>In a world that increasingly relies on technology for its day-to-day operations, cyber threats are more and more important to understand in the business world. The current landscape requires local family businesses to be aware of cyber threats just as much as the largest Fortune 500 companies in the ever-evolving cyber domain. The Loyola Blakefield Cyber Challenge aims to prepare the next generation regardless of career aspirations for the future landscape of business. Educating students on computer management and cyber threats is essential to future success in a workplace which will inevitably rely on understanding the technology which runs it.</p>
