    <h2 class="text-yellow-200 text-4xl font-black mt-8 mx-20 text-center"> How Can I Get Involved?</h2>
    <p class="mx-20 text-center text-white text-xl mt-2">In a world that increasingly relies on technology for its day-to-day operations, cyber threats are more and more important to understand in the business world. The current landscape requires local family businesses to be aware of cyber threats just as much as the largest Fortune 500 companies in the ever-evolving cyber domain. The Loyola Blakefield Cyber Challenge aims to prepare the next generation, regardless of career aspirations, for the future landscape of business. Educating students on computer management and cyber threats is essential to future success in a workplace which will inevitably rely on understanding the technology which runs it.</p>
    <h3 class="text-yellow-100 text-2xl font-bold mt-4 text-center">Attendance</h3>

        <h2 class="text-yellow-200 text-4xl font-black m-8 text-center">IOT City</h2>
        <p class=" text-center text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-8">IoT (Internet of Things) is how different appliances, or things, connect and communicate with each other. This can include your home security camera, phone, and even your toaster! IoT is becoming increasingly relevant as more household devices become "smart", and will only grow more so. LBC2's IoT City challenges consist of six separate Capture the Flag-style challenges with an IoT twist. Ranging in difficulty from Intro to Advanced, the challenges test competitors’ knowledge of both basic cybersecurity and IoT elements. Last year, we featured a series of IOT-themed challenges revolving around common industrial “things”, such as traffic lights, billboards, and a water tower. We're working on new and exciting content to add to the city, so stay tuned!</p>
