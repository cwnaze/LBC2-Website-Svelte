    <p class="mx-20 text-center text-white text-xl mt-2">In a world that increasingly relies on technology for its day-to-day operations, cyber threats are more and more important to understand in the business world. The current landscape requires local family businesses to be aware of cyber threats just as much as the largest Fortune 500 companies in the ever-evolving cyber domain. The Loyola Blakefield Cyber Challenge aims to prepare the next generation regardless of career aspirations for the future landscape of business. Educating students on computer management and cyber threats is essential to future success in a workplace which will inevitably rely on understanding the technology which runs it.</p>

    <p class="mx-20 text-center text-white text-xl mt-2">This year, the LBC2 competition day also featured a parent track for the parents and guardians of the competitors to learn what the competitors are learning by competing in LBC2, the importance of cybersecurity in today’s society, and how they can support their children in learning more about cybersecurity later on. The parent track was a huge success and will return next year.</p>

        <p class=" text-center text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-8">The IoT (Internet of Things) City challenges were a resounding success. Consisting of six separate Capture the Flag style challenges with an IoT twist, ranging in difficulty from Intro to Advanced, the challenges tested competitors’ knowledge of both basic cybersecurity and IoT elements. The Internet of Things is an idea of how different appliances, or things, connect and communicate with each other. This can include your home security camera, phone, and even your toaster! This year, we featured a series of IOT-themed challenges revolving around common industrial “things”, such as traffic lights, billboards, and a water tower.</p>
