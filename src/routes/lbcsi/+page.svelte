        <p class="text-white text-2xl my-8 mx-20 text-center">LBCSI is a student run initiative and directed by Steve Morrill, Head of Technology & Cyber Science at Loyola Blakefield. He has been at the school for seventeen years and started the club along with just a few other students back in 2011. With his dedication and mentorship, the club has expanded to what it is today, and without him, none of this would exist.</p>
